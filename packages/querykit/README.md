# QueryKit

QueryKit is a registry-backed JSON query compiler for TypeScript apps.

At its core, QueryKit should expose two standard contracts:

```txt
1. Query Schema
2. Registry Schema
```

Given an untrusted JSON query and a trusted registry, QueryKit validates what is allowed, lowers the query into a normalized IR, and hands that IR to an adapter such as Drizzle or Prisma.

```txt
unknown JSON
  -> QuerySpecSchema
  -> ResolvedRegistry validation
  -> QueryIR
  -> adapter compiler
  -> adapter execution
```

The package is currently private under the `@ypanagidis` npm scope.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @ypanagidis/querykit@alpha
```

## Usage

Most applications should use `createQueryRuntime`. The runtime resolves the
registry, validates and binds query params, lowers to IR, compiles SQL, executes
through an adapter, and validates result rows.

```ts
import { createQueryRuntime } from "@ypanagidis/querykit";
import { drizzleExecutor } from "@ypanagidis/querykit-drizzle";

const spec = {
  version: "v1",
  source: "placement",
  select: ["name", "budget"],
  where: { field: "budget", op: "gte", value: { $param: "minBudget" } },
  orderBy: [{ field: "budget", direction: "desc" }],
  limit: { $param: "limit" },
};

const runtime = createQueryRuntime({
  db,
  physicalRegistry: physical,
  defaults,
  policy,
  dialect: "mysql",
  executor: drizzleExecutor(),
});

const result = await runtime.run({
  spec,
  params: {
    minBudget: 10000,
    limit: 50,
  },
  explain: true,
});

console.log(result.rows);
console.log(result.explain.sqlPlan);
```

When `explain: true` is passed, `result.explain` is typed as present and includes
the resolved registry, `QueryIR`, and `SQLPlan`. Omit `explain` for just rows.

## Runtime Errors

`runtime.run(...)` does not wrap every failure in one catch-all error. It keeps
stage errors visible so callers can handle the right boundary:

- Registry parsing/resolution failures throw `RegistryParseError` or `RegistryResolutionError`.
- Query parsing/validation failures throw `QueryParseError` or `QueryValidationError`.
- Missing `$param` values and invalid param types are `QueryValidationError` issues.
- Adapter execution failures are thrown by the configured executor. For Drizzle, `drizzleExecutor()` uses `DrizzleExecutionError` from `@ypanagidis/querykit-drizzle`.
- Result row validation failures come from the result schema parser.

Validation happens before execution. If params are missing or invalid, the
executor is not called.

## Advanced APIs

The runtime is a small wrapper over lower-level APIs. Use these directly when you
need to inspect or customize individual compiler stages.

```ts
import {
  compileQuerySpecToSQL,
  lowerQuerySpecToIR,
  parseQuerySpec,
  resolveRegistry,
  validateQuerySpec,
} from "@ypanagidis/querykit";

const query = parseQuerySpec(spec);
const registry = resolveRegistry({ physical, defaults, policy });
const validatedQuery = validateQuerySpec({ query, registry, params });
const ir = lowerQuerySpecToIR({ query: validatedQuery, registry, params });
const sqlPlan = compileQuerySpecToSQL({ query: validatedQuery, registry, dialect: "postgres" });
```

All schemas are also exported directly for advanced validation flows:

```ts
import { QuerySpecSchema, ResolvedRegistrySchema } from "@ypanagidis/querykit";

const result = QuerySpecSchema.safeParse(input);
```

## Effect API

The core pipeline is Effect-first. Sync and promise helpers are convenience facades.
The Effect APIs are exposed from the Effect subpath:

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect";
import {
  compileQuerySpecToSQLEffect,
  lowerQuerySpecToIREffect,
  resolveRegistryEffect,
  validateQuerySpecEffect,
} from "@ypanagidis/querykit/effect";

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const registry = yield* resolveRegistryEffect({ physical, defaults, policy });
  const validatedQuery = yield* validateQuerySpecEffect({ query, registry, params });
  const ir = yield* lowerQuerySpecToIREffect({ query: validatedQuery, registry, params });
  const sqlPlan = yield* compileQuerySpecToSQLEffect({
    query: validatedQuery,
    registry,
    dialect: "postgres",
  });

  return { registry, validatedQuery, ir, sqlPlan };
});
```

Resolver failures are Effect-native tagged errors:

```ts
program.pipe(
  Effect.catchTags({
    RegistryParseError: (error) => Effect.succeed(error.error),
    RegistryResolutionError: (error) => Effect.succeed(error.issues),
  }),
);
```

## QueryIR And SQLPlan

Query lowering validates the query, resolves public paths to physical field refs,
and emits deduplicated joins. The current IR is adapter-neutral:


```ts
type QueryIR = {
  kind: "select";
  source: QueryIRSourceRef;
  select: QueryIRFieldRef[];
  joins: QueryIRJoin[];
  where?: QueryIRFilter;
  groupBy: QueryIRFieldRef[];
  orderBy: QueryIROrderBy[];
  limit?: number;
  offset?: number;
};
```

The SQL compiler returns raw SQL plus bound params. It defaults to MySQL and can
also emit PostgreSQL or SQLite SQL:

```ts
type SQLDialect = "mysql" | "postgres" | "sqlite";

type SQLPlan = {
  dialect: SQLDialect;
  sql: string;
  params: readonly JsonValue[];
};
```

## Core Contracts

### Query Schema

The query schema is the public JSON shape accepted by QueryKit.

It should describe query intent, not raw SQL:

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "source": "placement",
  "select": ["name", "status", "budget", "campaign.name"],
  "where": {
    "and": [
      { "field": "status", "op": "eq", "value": { "$param": "status" } },
      { "field": "budget", "op": "gte", "value": { "$param": "minBudget" } }
    ]
  },
  "orderBy": [{ "field": "budget", "direction": "desc" }],
  "limit": { "$param": "limit" }
}
```

The query schema should not expose raw table names, raw column names, raw SQL fragments, or arbitrary function names.

`$param` references are bound from `params` during validation, before SQL compilation. Missing params fail validation; filter params are checked against the resolved field type; params used for `limit` or `offset` must be non-negative integers.

### Saved Query Templates

Because params are supplied separately, a query can be saved as reusable JSON and
run with different request values:

```ts
const activePlacementReport = await loadQueryTemplate("active-placement-report");

const result = await runtime.run({
  spec: activePlacementReport,
  params: {
    status: "active",
    minBudget: 10000,
    campaignName: "spring",
    limit: 25,
  },
  explain: true,
});
```

The template stays stable:

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "source": "placement",
  "select": ["name", "status", "budget", "campaign.name"],
  "where": {
    "and": [
      { "field": "status", "op": "eq", "value": { "$param": "status" } },
      { "field": "budget", "op": "gte", "value": { "$param": "minBudget" } },
      { "field": "campaign.name", "op": "contains", "value": { "$param": "campaignName" } }
    ]
  },
  "limit": { "$param": "limit" }
}
```

### Field Paths And Derived Joins

QueryKit intentionally uses public dotted field paths for relation fields:

```txt
name
budget
campaign.name
```

This keeps UI builders simple: a field picker can emit the selected public path directly into `select`, `where`, `groupBy`, or `orderBy`.

Dotted paths do not create arbitrary joins. During validation, every path segment must exist in the resolved registry and must have the required capability:

```txt
campaign.name
  -> placement has an exposed campaign relation
  -> campaign traversal is selectable/filterable for this query position
  -> campaign is within maxDepth
  -> campaign has an exposed name field
```

After validation, QueryKit derives a deduplicated join plan from those field paths. The join plan is visible in `QueryIR.joins` and is what the SQL compiler uses.

So relation traversal is implicit in the public query for UI ergonomics, but explicit in the compiled plan for inspection and execution.

### Registry Schema

The registry defines the allowed query universe.

QueryKit uses three registry layers:

```txt
PhysicalRegistry
  generated from ORM/schema metadata

RegistryPolicy
  user-authored allowlist and customization layer

ResolvedRegistry
  per-request effective registry used by validation and compilation
```

The physical registry says what exists.

The registry policy says what is exposed.

The resolved registry is generated from both, plus engine defaults.

```ts
const resolved = resolveRegistry({
  physical,
  defaults,
  policies,
});
```

Resolution should be cheap and deterministic. It can happen on every query call so field visibility, limits, relation depth, and capabilities can vary by tenant, role, feature flag, or UI-managed configuration.

## Registry Shape

The physical registry is adapter-generated and close to the ORM/database model:

```ts
type PhysicalRegistry = {
  sources: Record<string, PhysicalSource>;
};

type PhysicalSource = {
  kind: "table" | "view" | "model";
  name: string;
  schema?: string;
  primaryKey?: string[];
  fields: Record<string, PhysicalField>;
  relations?: Record<string, PhysicalRelation>;
};
```

The policy is user-authored data. It can come from code, a database, generated configuration, or a future UI.

```ts
const policy = {
  sources: {
    placements: {
      expose: true,
      exposeAs: "placement",
      fields: {
        name: {
          expose: true,
          filterable: true,
          sortable: true,
        },
        budgetCents: {
          expose: true,
          exposeAs: "budget",
          type: "number",
          filterable: true,
          sortable: true,
          aggregations: ["sum", "avg"],
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

The resolved registry is what QueryKit actually compiles against. Queries only reference public names from the resolved registry.

```txt
placement.budget -> placements.budgetCents
placement.campaign.name -> join placements.campaignId = campaigns.id, then campaigns.name
```

Resolved relations preserve the physical join keys needed by later IR lowering:

```ts
type ResolvedRelation = {
  physicalSource: string;
  physicalRelation: string;
  target: string;
  kind: "one" | "many";
  localFields: string[];
  foreignFields: string[];
};
```

## Adapters

Adapters have two jobs:

```txt
ORM/schema -> PhysicalRegistry
SQLPlan -> adapter execution
```

For Drizzle:

```txt
Drizzle schema -> PhysicalRegistry
SQLPlan -> db.execute(...)
```

The Drizzle adapter lives in `@ypanagidis/querykit-drizzle`, not core QueryKit. It can create a `PhysicalRegistry` from Drizzle rc3 relation metadata and execute `SQLPlan` through `db.execute(...)`. Core stays ORM-agnostic and produces `SQLPlan`; adapter packages execute or translate that plan.

For Prisma:

```txt
Prisma schema -> PhysicalRegistry
QueryIR -> Prisma raw SQL initially
```

Prisma object-query compilation can be added later for the subset Prisma can represent cleanly. The core should not be shaped around Prisma's `findMany` API.

## Current Alpha

The current alpha exposes the public Zod schema layer for `QuerySpec`, `PhysicalRegistry`, `RegistryPolicy`, `RegistryDefaults`, and `ResolvedRegistry`, plus the runtime pipeline around these contracts:

```txt
QuerySpecSchema.parse
  -> resolveRegistry
  -> validateQuerySpec
  -> lowerQuerySpecToIR
  -> compileQuerySpecToSQL
  -> adapter.execute
```

Drivers remain useful as an optional layer for business-specific specs:

```txt
business JSON
  -> driver
  -> QuerySpec
  -> QueryKit core
```

## Design Constraints

QueryKit should not become:

```txt
- a BI platform
- a no-code backend
- an ORM
- a GraphQL server
- a public SQL-in-JSON language
- an authorization framework
```

The registry controls query shape and field exposure. Per-user row-level authorization and mandatory tenant constraints should be supplied by the host application.
